The cities of the future will no longer be built solely by human efforts.

Artificial intelligence and robots will replace humans in repetitive labor. When designing new structures, AI can propose creative architectural designs based on given conditions, while during construction, robots will handle repetitive and physical tasks such as moving bricks or applying cement. We refer to these AI and robotic systems developed to support urban architecture and construction as “Urban Space Robots.”

As Urban Space Robots become more efficiently utilized, the role and responsibility of urban planners—the decision-makers using these systems—will become increasingly significant. In the past, the process from design to construction took a considerable amount of time. However, advancements in Urban Space Robots have ushered in an era where urban planning simulations can quickly be realized in physical reality. Yet, if decision-makers misuse these systems for personal power or gain, the consequences could be devastating. Human rights may be ignored, the environment destroyed, and dilapidated abandoned buildings could proliferate. Additionally, crime and fire incidents might surge, and poor financial management could undermine the provision of basic welfare. Just as social media has deeply penetrated human minds, often compromising mental well-being, Urban Space Robots could pose a dangerous risk by infiltrating and even controlling the physical world, potentially compromising bodily autonomy.

Today, urbanization has brought numerous challenges. Highly concentrated urban populations have led to skyrocketing real estate prices, declining labor income value, the spread of speculative get-rich-quick attitudes, falling marriage rates, low birth rates, rising individualism, and increasing solitary deaths. These issues are not merely individual responsibilities but rather societal "costs" incurred from prioritizing short-term economic gains over sustainable urban development. Historically, even individuals who demonstrated neighborly love and worked tirelessly for national or urban betterment have faced jealousy, conflicts of interest, and undue disparagement. Their contributions have sometimes been undervalued or distorted, leading even those with both power and goodwill to hesitate in taking on leadership roles.

In the future, Urban Space Robots will connect more deeply with citizens' communications. Citizens will actively express the discomfort, anxiety, and dissatisfaction they experience in daily life, and AI will aggregate this information using big data collection devices to reflect it in urban development. This process will help reduce citizen unhappiness, foster mutual understanding of roles and perspectives, and enhance communication. We envision a future where, instead of a small group of leaders unilaterally guiding progress, every citizen contributes to creating a better city and community, collectively shaping the nation’s and humanity’s development. Through Urban Space Robots, we hope to promote communication and neighborly love, reminding citizens that leaders, too, are humans striving for the common good. 

This dissertation aims to take a small but meaningful step toward that future.
