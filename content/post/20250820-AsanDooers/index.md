The Divercity House team has been selected as one of the **seven finalist teams** for the *Chung Ju-Young Startup Competition Demo Day* ðŸŽ‰ (out of 27 teams in the preliminaries).  

Over the past two months, we have been commuting every Friday between **Busan** and **Seoul MARU180**, refining both our development and marketing. During the IR pitching, rather than focusing solely on technical features, we highlighted our mission: **to build a fair and trustworthy housing and settlement solution for foreigners**. This focus allowed us to deliver not just technology, but also the problem awareness and values behind our work, which resonated with many.

This achievement carries personal meaning for me as well. During my Ph.D. studies at KAIST, I researched **urban human mobility AI**, always dreaming of one day building a startup that could analyze real customer data and generate meaningful value. Now, that dream is gradually becoming reality.  

We have also witnessed **small but meaningful changes**. More than *50 tenants* who signed leases through our service are now actively sharing updates and supporting each other in our community chat room. Seeing this gave me confidence that our CEOâ€™s sincere **customer-first philosophy** is being realized.  

We are still at the beginning, but we aim to grow into a fast-scaling startup. My gratitude goes to **CEO Dong Soo LEE, designer JeongMin Sohn, and global marketer Vicent Segura Bilekera** for their dedication. Special thanks as well to **Asan Doers** for organizing this invaluable opportunity and to the **UD Impact coaches** for their guidance and support. ^^
