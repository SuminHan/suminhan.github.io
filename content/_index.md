        Daejeon is a very nice city where <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">SCIENCE</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fcd_ance/?__coig_challenged=1">ART</a> are growing harmoniously.
        I am dreaming of building a startup among the various career path options, whose ultimate goal is described in this <a href="./post/20241118-urban-space-robot/">ESSAY</a>.
