SUBMISSION: 972
TITLE: Enhancing Spatio-temporal Traffic Prediction through Urban Human Activity Analysis

-------------------------  METAREVIEW  ------------------------
RECOMMENDATION: accept
TEXT:
Strengths:
-Adding urban human activity analysis to the task of predicting traffic
-Solid experimental results
-Merging different sources and types of data
-Code and data publicly available


Weaknesses:
-Lack of a proper explanation and discussion on the choice of hyperparameters and hyperparameters tuning procedures
-Lack of sufficient statistical analysis of the significance of the results
-Limitations, potential biases, and generalizability should be discussed more in detail
-Manuscript presentation could be improved


The paper proposes a traffic prediction method based on graph convolution deep learning algorithms that leverage human activity frequency data from National Household Travel Survey to improve inference capabilities. The manuscript could benefit from a more detailed discussion on a few methodological steps, e.g., hyperparameters tuning, statistical significance, generalizability, limitations, and biases following reviewers’ comments. Despite that, the general contributions are clear and the methodology solid, the topic is relevant for the conference audience, and it has an obvious potential impact on urban traffic policies.

SUBMISSION: 972
TITLE: Enhancing Spatio-temporal Traffic Prediction through Urban Human Activity Analysis
AUTHORS: Sumin Han, Youngjun Park, Minji Lee, Jisun An and Dongman Lee

----------- Strengths -----------
The paper proposes an improved traffic prediction method based on graph convolution deep learning algorithms. The authors leverage human activity frequency data to enhance the inference capability of a causal relationship between activity and traffic patterns. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance without introducing excessive computational overhead.
----------- Weaknesses -----------
(1) In the Evaluation Setup section (in page 5), the authors set the hyperparameters for the Transformer model, including the number of attention heads, key dimension, total dimension, and number of layers. The authors should provide a justification for their choice of these hyperparameters. This will help readers understand why the selected hyperparameters are appropriate for the proposed method.
(2) It can be observed from Tables 2 and 4 that the SETF model performs well, and in some datasets, it even outperforms the UAGCRN and UAFCTF models proposed by the authors. Therefore, it is suggested that the authors perform hyperparameters tuning for the two proposed models to further determine their optimal hyperparameters settings.
----------- Overall evaluation -----------
SCORE: 1 (weak accept)

----- TEXT:
The research background of this article is focused on improving spatiotemporal traffic prediction through the analysis of urban human activity. Previous methods in traffic prediction often rely on historical traffic data and do not consider the influence of human activities such as events, festivals, and shopping patterns. This article proposes a research method that incorporates urban human activity analysis into traffic prediction models. The method utilizes various data sources, including social media, geographic data, and urban event calendars, to capture human activity patterns and their impact on traffic. The proposed method achieved accurate and reliable traffic prediction results, outperforming previous approaches. The performance of the method supports the goal of enhancing spatiotemporal traffic prediction by considering the influence of urban human activities.
