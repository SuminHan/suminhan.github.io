abstract: Point of interest (POI) in an urban space represents the perception of city dwellers and visitors of a certain place. LTE cell tower access trace data is one of the promising data sources which has the potential to show real-time POI exploitation analysis. However, there is not much discussion on how it is correlated to diachronic POIs and their exploitation pattern. In this paper, we first show that the access trace pattern from the LTE cell tower can be used to discover which types of POIs exist in a certain area. Then, we propose a daily POI exploitation discovery scheme which can extract patterns of how POIs are daily used. Our analysis can provide a good insight into future urban space-based services such as urban planning and tourism.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper demonstrates that LTE cell tower access trace data can reveal the types of Points of Interest (POIs) in an area and introduces a daily POI exploitation discovery scheme to analyze how POIs are used daily, offering valuable insights for urban planning and tourism services.
