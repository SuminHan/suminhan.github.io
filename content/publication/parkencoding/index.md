abstract: Despite advancements in real estate appraisal methods, this study primarily focuses on two pivotal challenges. Firstly, we explore the often-underestimated impact of Points of Interest (POI) on property values, emphasizing the necessity for a comprehensive, data-driven approach to feature selection. Secondly, we integrate road-network-based Areal Embedding to enhance spatial understanding for real estate appraisal. We first propose a revised method for POI feature extraction, and discuss the impact of each POI for house price appraisal. Then we present the Areal embedding-enabled Masked Multihead Attention-based Spatial Interpolation for House Price Prediction (AMMASI) model, an improvement upon the existing ASI model, which leverages masked multi-head attention on geographic neighbor houses and similar-featured houses. Our model outperforms current baselines and also offers promising avenues for future optimization in real estate appraisal methodologies.



# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study addresses the impact of Points of Interest (POI) on property values and introduces the AMMASI model, which enhances real estate appraisal by incorporating road-network-based Areal Embedding and masked multi-head attention, significantly improving house price prediction compared to existing models.
